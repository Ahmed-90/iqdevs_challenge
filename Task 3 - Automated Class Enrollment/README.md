A local non-profit educational organization wants to increase material coveraege and minimize annual expences by using a piece of software capable of laying out a year-long (three-semester) class schedule for its eligiable participants. The organization is essentially interested in providing a list of available classes to the system. It is, then, the automated tool's job to distribute eligable students across classes in a manner that leavs no empty chairs behind. If a class is not full, it can be marked off as unavailable for that specific year timeframe.

Eligibility is to be discerned as follows:
* Participants under the age of 16 and over the age of 63 are uneligiable.
* Students with no high school degree or an equivilent degree (GED, for instance) are uneligable.
* Everyone else among the participants is eligiable.

Class distribution rules:
* Every class must be 100% full (no unoccupied chairs). If a class is not full, it is to be caneled and enrolled participants need to be enrolled in a different class among the ones available.
* Age matters. Every participant in class must be within a 5-year (on each side) age range of everyone else.
* Participants must NOT occupy more than one class of one category per semester. For instance, one participant must not be enrolled in "History of Music" and "Greek and Roman History" at the same time since both classes are in the History category.
